The .scad files are the program files for the 3D designs. They were modeled using OpenSCAD, a 3D modeler that uses code. To see a 3D representation of the files, the .STL folder has a few. Of special notice are the carriage and platform designs.

SpectraStock
============

A design based on the original Rostock (https://github.com/jcrocholl/rostock) which allows for easy implementation of a Spectra-line driven system.

Original Rostock frame is still being used. The carriage spectra-line tensioning is based off of what the Tantillus printer did (https://github.com/Intrinsically-Sublime/Tantillus)
